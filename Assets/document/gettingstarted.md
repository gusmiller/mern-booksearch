# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Getting Started
In order for this application to use a GraphQL API, you’ll need to refactor the API to use GraphQL on the back end and add some functionality to the front end. The following sections contain details about the files you’ll need to modify on the back end and the front end.

**Important**: Make sure to study the application before building upon it. Better yet, start by making a copy of it. It's already a working application&mdash;you're converting it from RESTful API practices to a GraphQL API.
